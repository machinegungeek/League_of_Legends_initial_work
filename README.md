# League_of_Legends_initial_work
Some basic work investigating a Kaggle LoL dataset.

The main methods used are in the script 'basic_stats.py' and a call is made to the 'affine_plotter.py' script used in my graduate work (more specifically, the 'mod_ref_short_combo' method, with key='LOOCV'). Currently, a bunch of the analysis is stuck in some 'hacker' mode windows and needs to, in the future, be copied to the end of 'basic_stats.py'.
